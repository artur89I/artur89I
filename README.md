## Hi there 👋

👨🏻‍💻 I’m Artur, a Junior QA Engineer with an ISTQB certification and a strong passion for delivering high-quality software. During my university days, while working on projects like a Bug-Tracking Management System and dynamic web applications, I discovered how much I enjoyed testing, debugging, and improving systems. That’s when I realized—I wanted to become a QA Engineer.

Since then, I’ve designed and executed robust test scripts, managed bugs using Azure DevOps and Jira, and collaborated closely with Agile teams. I’ve contributed to projects involving Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and tested Android and iOS mobile applications for performance, usability, and functionality.

💡 One of my proudest achievements is building a scalable end-to-end automated testing framework with Playwright and JavaScript. It significantly improved regression testing and cut down manual effort. I also have hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver and WebdriverIO.

🔭 I’m currently deepening my skills in test automation, focusing on Selenium with Java and Playwright with TypeScript. I enjoy tackling new challenges and continuously growing my technical toolkit.

🧪 I’m eager to collaborate on real-world projects where I can contribute with both manual and automated testing skills. Let’s connect and build something bug-free together!
